<h1>"It's lonely at the <span>top</span>. Ninety-nine percent of people in <span>the</span> world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of <span>competition</span> is thus fiercest for 'realistic' goals, paradoxically making them the most time and energy-consuming."</h1>
